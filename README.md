Objective
This project aims to accurately classify and detect phishing emails, providing practical insights to prevent individuals from falling victim to phishing attacks in real-world scenarios.
Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is "Phishing Email Detection" by subhajournal, available on Kaggle: Phishing Email Detection Dataset. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhajournal/phishingemails
It contains labelled email data, with features representing various attributes of the emails. It contains 18,634 emails out of which 60.76% are safe and the rest are phishing attempts. 
Problem Formulation
Phishing is a cybercrime tactic where attackers impersonate legitimate entities to deceive individuals into disclosing sensitive information such as login credentials, financial details, or personal data. The primary goal of this project is to accurately classify phishing and safe emails to combat the increasing rates of phishing attacks.
Statistics on Phishing
An estimated 3.4 billion emails are sent in a day by cybercriminals.
Over 48% of emails sent in 2022 were spam.
Around 36% of all data breaches involve phishing.
In 2022, APWG logged approximately 4.7 million phishing attacks. Since 2019, the number of phishing attacks has increased by more than 150% yearly.
Individuals working for educational institutions are most likely to open a phishing email.
$44.2 million stolen by cyber criminals through phishing attacks in 2021.
323,972 internet users fell victim to phishing attacks in 2021.

Project Flow:
Data Cleaning and Preparation
Removal of null values
Removal of irrelevant characters and symbols
Conversion to lowercase for standardisation
Structured labelling for ease of analysis (Phishing = 1, Safe = 0)

Exploratory Data Analysis
Assessing the distribution of email classes
Summarizing length distributions of the different email types

Analytical Visualization
Visualization of the distributions of lengths of the email types
WordCloud visualization to gain insight into word frequency
Identifying the most common words in both email types
Sentiment Analysis and visualization

Training ML Models and Algorithmic Optimization
Tokenization and two types of Vectorization to process text data
Models Used: Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Neural Network, Support Vector Machine
Viewing evaluation metrics- precision, accuracy, F1 score- and assessing model performance through ROC curve, Learning Curve and Confusion matrix
Selecting the best-performing model 	

Testing Best Performing Model
Testing sample emails to show the accuracy of prediction
An email from NTU and a suspicious email from an unknown address were used. 

Results
The project achieved promising results in accurately classifying phishing and safe emails. The best-performing model was Support Vector Machine, achieving an accuracy of 97% on the test dataset. The insights gained from exploratory data analysis and analytical visualization provided valuable understanding of the characteristics of phishing emails.

Practical Implications
The findings of this project have practical implications in real-world scenarios, where individuals can use the developed model to identify and avoid phishing emails, thereby reducing the risk of falling victim to cyber attacks.
