## Objective üéØ
This project aims to accurately classify and detect phishing emails, providing practical insights to prevent individuals from falling victim to phishing attacks in real-world scenarios.

## Dataset Description üìä
The dataset used in this project is the "Phishing Email Detection" dataset by subhajournal, available on Kaggle: [Phishing Email Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhajournal/phishingemails). It consists of email text and email types (Safe and Phishing). Out of 18,634 emails, 60.76% are safe, and the rest are phishing attempts. There are also 16 unclassified values.

## Problem Formulation ü§î
Phishing is a cybercrime tactic where attackers impersonate legitimate entities to deceive individuals into disclosing sensitive information such as login credentials, financial details, or personal data. The primary goal of this project is to accurately classify phishing and safe emails to combat the increasing rates of phishing attacks.

## Key Statistics on Phishing üìà
- 3.4 billion emails are sent daily by cybercriminals.
- Over 48% of emails sent in 2022 were spam.
- Around 36% of all data breaches involve phishing.
- In 2022, APWG logged approximately 4.7 million phishing attacks, increasing by more than 150% yearly since 2019.
- Educational institution employees are most likely to open a phishing email.
- Cybercriminals stole $44.2 million through phishing attacks in 2021.
- 323,972 internet users fell victim to phishing attacks in 2021.

## Project Flow üîÑ
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation** üßπ
   - Removal of null values
   - Removal of irrelevant characters and symbols
   - Conversion to lowercase for standardisation
   - Structured labelling for ease of analysis (Phishing = 1, Safe = 0)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** üîç
   - Distribution analysis: 11,322 safe emails and 7,312 phishing emails.
   - Length distributions: Phishing emails are generally shorter, possibly to create urgency.
   - Sentiment Analysis: Phishing emails tend to use more emotional language.

3. **Analytical Visualization** üìä
   - Length distribution visualization
   - WordCloud for word frequency insights
   - Identifying common words
   - Sentiment Analysis visualization

4. **Training ML Models and Algorithmic Optimization** ü§ñ
   - Tokenization: Breaking text into tokens for analysis.
   - Vectorization: Using TF-IDF to assign numerical values to words.
   - Models: Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, GRU Neural Network, Support Vector Machine.
   - Evaluation metrics: precision, accuracy, F1 score, ROC curve, Learning Curve, Confusion matrix.

5. **Testing Best Performing Model** üß™
   - Testing sample emails for prediction accuracy.

## Results üìä
The project achieved promising results in accurately classifying phishing and safe emails. Although regression, random forest, and GRU neural network were very good models too, the best-performing model was Support Vector Machine, achieving an accuracy of 97% on the test dataset. The insights gained from exploratory data analysis and analytical visualization provided valuable understanding of the characteristics of phishing emails.

### Lessons Learned:
- Handling datasets that need thorough analysis and cleaning before usage.
- Utilizing new tools for data visualization and analysis such as WordCloud and Sentiment Analysis.
- Tokenization of text for machine learning model processing.
- Introduction and implementation of various algorithms like Random Forest, GRU Neural Network, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine.
- Working with libraries like Keras and Tensorflow.
- Assessing model correctness based on precision, recall, F1 score, learning curve, ROC curve, confusion matrix, and epochs.

### Conclusion:
- Multiple models can be used to classify emails with varying accuracy.
- Phishing emails often exhibit distinct features that aid in prediction.
- Data preprocessing significantly improves model performance.
- Visualizing data before modelling provides crucial insights.
- Implementing similar models in real-world scenarios for phishing email identification is viable.

## Practical Implications üíº
The findings of this project have practical implications in real-world scenarios, where individuals can use the developed model to identify and avoid phishing emails, thereby reducing the risk of falling victim to cyber attacks.
